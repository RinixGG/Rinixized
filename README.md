# Rinixized

Quilt-based modpack primarily for technical minecraft players. Rinixized provides you great perfomance boost with a lot of QoL stuff like [litematica printer](https://github.com/aria1th/litematica-printer), [item scroller](https://github.com/aria1th/itemscroller-crafting-fix), [nether coords](https://modrinth.com/mod/nether-coords), [recursive resources](https://modrinth.com/mod/recursiveresources), [tweakeroo](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tweakeroo) etc. The modpack also has some OptiFine features([continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity), [capes](https://modrinth.com/mod/capes), [zoomify](https://modrinth.com/mod/zoomify)) as well as useful building and farm-designing tools like [WorldEdit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit) and [Carpet Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/carpet).

# Q&A

Q: Will there be support for 1.19.3?

A: Maybe yes. 1.19.3 edition isn't ready because some important mods haven't been updated yet.


Q: How often will you update your modpack?

A: I think I can call it rolling release modpack so updates will come out frequently.


Q: How can I suggest a mod for your modpack?

A: You can [open an issue](https://github.com/RinixGG/Rinixized/issues) on GitHub.

# Plans for the future

I'm planning to make more modpack editions in the future and also improve some aspects. If you have any suggestion feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/RinixGG/Rinixized/issues) on GitHub.
